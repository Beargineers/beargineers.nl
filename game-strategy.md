### Ranking point trade-offs
- **Pattern RP**: skipped spindle/indexer to keep a high throughput shooter.
- **Movement RP**: heavy robot makes lifting slow; focus on leaving the shooting zone and fast parking instead.
- **Ball count RP**: rely on low cycle times and scoring volume to offset indexing sacrifices.

### Flexibility
- **Shoot from far or close**: compensate for alliance partners with limited range.
- **Slightly slimmer than 18\"**: full park while partner partially parks for more points and RP.
- **Defense ready**: durable structure built to handle and play defense.

Overall approach: prioritize fast cycles and adaptable positioning to pair well with varied alliance robots.
