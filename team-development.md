### School lobby demonstration
- Full FTC field in the lobby; hundreds of students observed matches, asked questions, and drove the robot.
- Shared videos on school displays explaining FTC and how to join.

### Skill-building cadence
1. **Skills matrix** at season start: 0–3 scale to baseline every member.
2. **Weekly 60-minute training blocks**: one software, one mechanical/design, one documentation/testing topic.
3. **Biweekly skill checks**: small deliverables (sensor integration, controller tuning, part design, documented decisions).
4. **Teach-back lessons**: monthly peer teaching to cement mastery.
5. **Review and adjust**: monthly planning for next skills and support.

### Outreach to younger students
- Simple robotics demos in classes with visual explanations to spark early STEM interest.
