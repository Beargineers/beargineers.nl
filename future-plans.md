### Team development & knowledge transfer
- Maintain clear documentation of designs, code, and lessons learned.
- Pair experienced members with newer students; involve younger members directly in building, programming, and testing.

### Education & skill building
- Run regular meetings focused on engineering, programming, and design fundamentals.
- Introduce CAD, manufacturing, and software concepts early to emphasize problem-solving over quick builds.

### Recruitment & growth
- Continue school-wide demos and outreach to attract new members (especially as many current members are seniors).
- Use visible projects and competition footage to spark interest; lower entry barriers for beginners with structured learning.

### Organization & continuity
- Define roles and responsibilities clearly; build season timelines and milestones.
- Prepare underclassmen for future leadership to ensure smooth transitions and sustained club health.
