### 2024–25 constraint
- School budget: €2000. Costs added up quickly, so we prioritized:
  - Reusing and repairing parts from last season.
  - 3D-printed brackets/spacers and off-the-shelf hardware.
  - Minimal viable spares to avoid season-ending failures.
  - Designs that reduce part count (simple belt paths, modular subassemblies).

### 2025–26 plan
- Advocated for increase to **€3000**; presented evidence of last year’s constraints and reuse plan.
- Purchases (~$2,134.20) focused on long-term assets and reliability:
  - Strafe® mecanum chassis kit for holonomic alignment.
  - 4-bar odometry pack + hubs for accurate localization.
  - Yellow Jacket motors (1:1 / 5.2:1 / 13.7:1) for shooter, intake, mechanisms.
  - Distance sensor + adapters for artifact counting.
  - Timing belts, pulleys, idlers, tensioners, bearings, collars, standoffs.
  - Rhino/boot wheels for odometry and intake contact.
  - Budget for essential spares; optional mechanisms deferred.
