### Strategic objective
Sustainability through a strong talent pipeline from middle school into FTC.

### Junior Bear-League
- Turned weekly club into two rookie teams using old chassis and spare parts.
- Simulated season: seniors acted as GDC, rookies designed, built, and scrimmaged to experience FIRST before joining.
- Result: 100% of Junior League members committed to FTC next year.

### Recruiting non-technical mentors
- Pitched STEAM to Arts Department; recruited Mr. Van den Hoven (no prior robotics) to mentor portfolio design with biweekly critiques.

### Robot Driver’s License (RDL)
- Lunch-time precision driving course with a slowed robot; students earned 3D-printed licenses.
- Impact: 40% increase in non-STEM students asking about the club after RDL days.

### Metrics
- Recruitment, mentorship, awareness measured via commitments, mentor onboarded, and 125+ licenses issued.
